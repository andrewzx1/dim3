dim3's engine is designed for beginners and advanced users alike.  Changing the source code is not required; all facets of the engine can be altered through scripting.  Advanced developers are welcome to alter the code if they see the need.

dim3 comes with a GUI-based skeletal animator that can import from many different model formats and a GUI-based map editor.  Both tools are designed for rapid development of projects.

The engine compiles and runs on OS X, Windows XP, and various flavors of linux.  The tools are OS X only.All custom scripting is done through JavaScript.  The engine uses OpenGL, SDL and JavaScriptCore.

The license allows free use of the engine (with or without modification) without any strings as long as credit is given.
