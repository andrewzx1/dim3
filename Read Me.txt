Compiling dim3 require some open-source components that you will need to supply.
They are listed below:


For OS X Compile:
-----------------

/dim3Common/Frameworks/JS.framework (Webkit JS framework)
/dim3Common/Frameworks/PNG.framework (PNG library)
/dim3Common/Frameworks/mpg123.framework (MP3 library)
/dim3Common/Frameworks/SDL.framework (SDL library)

A pre-compiled archive of these can be found at: http://www.klinksoftware.net/download/OSX_Frameworks.zip

The OS X compile requires no additional external libraries.


For Win32 Compile:
------------------

/winBuild/Libraries/dim3 (leave empty, compile writes libraries here)
/winBuild/Libraries/GLEW (GLEW lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/JavaScriptCore (Webkit JS lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/PNG (PNG lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/MPG123 (mpg123 lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/SDL (SDL lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/ZLib (ZLib lib and headers)

A pre-compiled archive of these can be found at: http://www.klinksoftware.net/download/Win32_Libraries.zip

Currently, the win32 compile requires these DLLs:

CFLite.dll (for JS)
glew32.dll (for GLEW)
icudt40.dll icuin40.dll icuuc40.dll (for JS)
JavaScriptCore.dll (for JS)
libpng13.dll (for PNG)
libmpg123.dll (for MPG123)
pthreadVC2.dll (for JS)
SDL.dll (for SDL)
zlib1.dll (for ZLib)

You can get these by downloading the current win32 version of dim3.

On both OS X and Win32, the projects must be compiled in this order:

dim3BaseUtility
dim3ModelUtility (needs Base)
dim3MapUtility (needs Base)
dim3Engine (needs Base, Model, and Map)
