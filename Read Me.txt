Compiling dim3 require some open-source components that you will need to supply.
They are listed below:


For OS X Compile:
-----------------

/dim3Common/Frameworks/JS.framework (Webkit JS framework)
/dim3Common/Frameworks/PNG.framework (PNG library)
/dim3Common/Frameworks/SDL.framework (SDL library)

The OS X compile requires no additional external libraries.


For Win32 Compile:
------------------

/winBuild/Libraries/dim3 (leave empty, compile writes libraries here)
/winBuild/Libraries/GLEW (GLEW lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/JavaScriptCore (Webkit JS lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/PNG (PNG lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/SDL (SDL lib and headers)
/winBuild/Libraries/ZLib (ZLib lib and headers)

Currently, the win32 compile requires these DLLs:

CFLite.dll (for JS)
glew32.dll (for GLEW)
icudt40.dll icuin40.dll icuuc40.dll (for JS)
JavaScriptCore.dll (for JS)
libpng13.dll (for PNG)
pthreadVC2.dll (for JS)
SDL.dll (for SDL)
zlib1.dll (for ZLib)



============================================================================================

Compiling Order:

On both OS X and Win32, the projects must be compiled in this order:

dim3BaseUtility
dim3ModelUtility (needs Base)
dim3MapUtility (needs Base)
dim3Engine (needs Base, Model, and Map)
dim3Editor (OS X Only) (needs Base, Model, and Map)
dim3Animator (OS X Only) (needs Base, Model)
