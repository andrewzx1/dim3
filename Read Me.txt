Compiling dim3 require some open-source components that you will need to supply.
They are listed below:


For OS X Compile:
-----------------

/OSXBuild/Common/Libraries/PNG.framework (PNG lib and headers)
/OSXBuild/Common/Libraries/MPG123 (mpg123 lib and headers)
/OSXBuild/Common/Libraries/SDL (SDL lib and headers)

A pre-compiled archive of these can be found at: http://www.klinksoftware.net/download/OSX_Libraries.zip

The OS X compile requires no additional external libraries.


For Win32 Compile:
------------------

/winBuild/Common/Libraries/dim3 (leave empty, compile writes libraries here)
/winBuild/Common/Libraries/GLEW (GLEW lib and headers)
/winBuild/Common/Libraries/JavaScriptCore (Webkit JS lib and headers)
/winBuild/Common/Libraries/PNG (PNG lib and headers)
/winBuild/Common/Libraries/MPG123 (mpg123 lib and headers)
/winBuild/Common/Libraries/SDL (SDL lib and headers)
/winBuild/Common/Libraries/ZLib (ZLib lib and headers)

A pre-compiled archive of these can be found at: http://www.klinksoftware.net/download/Win32_Libraries.zip

Currently, the win32 compile requires these DLLs:

CFLite.dll (for JS)
glew32.dll (for GLEW)
icudt40.dll icuin40.dll icuuc40.dll (for JS)
JavaScriptCore.dll (for JS)
libpng13.dll (for PNG)
libmpg123.dll (for MPG123)
pthreadVC2.dll (for JS)
SDL.dll (for SDL)
zlib1.dll (for ZLib)

You can get these by downloading the current win32 version of dim3.


For iOS Compile:
-----------------

/iOSBuild/Common/Libraries/JavaScriptCore (Javascript static lib and headers)
/iOSBuild/Common/Libraries/PNG (PNG static lib and headers)
/iOSBuild/Common/Libraries/MPG123 (mpg123 static lib and headers)
/iOSBuild/Common/Libraries/SDL (SDL static lib and headers)

A pre-compiled archive of these can be found at: http://www.klinksoftware.net/download/iOS_Libraries.zip

The iPhone compile requires no additional external libraries.

NOTE: You must include the data directory inside the application to run it.  Check out
the run script in the engine build, this copies the data folder into the executable.

NOTE: The iOS build ONLY builds for devices, NOT for the simulator.  The emulated OpenGL is too
slow on the simulator and it's a bad representation of a running game.

NOTE: There is currently a patch I have for SDL because it doesn't fully support iOS events currently,
which means you will need to rely on my SDL build for now.


============================================================================================

The Projects:

The OS X projects are in the OSXBuild directory.
The iOS projects is in the iOSBuild directory.
The win32 projects are in the winbuild directory.

============================================================================================

Pre-processor Macros:

D3_ENGINE, D3_EDITOR = which program we are compiling for
TARGET_IPHONE = for the iphone compile
D3_PCH = if precompiled header file needs to be included in source (OS X compile doesn't need it, win32 does)
D3_OPENRL = for experimental OpenRL compile
