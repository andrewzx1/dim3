Compiling dim3 require some open-source components that you will need to supply.  They are listed below:


For OS X Compile:
-----------------

/dim3Common/Frameworks/JS.framework (Webkit JS framework)
/dim3Common/Frameworks/PNG.framework (PNG library)
/dim3Common/Frameworks/SDL.framework (SDL library)

The OS X compile requires no additional external libraries.


For Win32 Compile:
------------------

/winBuild/libraries/dim3 (leave empty, compile writes libraries here)
/winBuild/libraries/GLEW (GLEW lib and headers)
/winBuild/libraries/JavaScriptCore (Webkit JS lib and headers)
/winBuild/libraries/PNG (PNG lib and headers)
/winBuild/libraries/SDL (SDL lib and headers)
/winBuild/libraries/ZLib (ZLib lib and headers)

Currently, the win32 compile requires these DLLs:

CFLite.dll (for JS)
glew32.dll (for GLEW)
icudt40.dll icuin40.dll icuuc40.dll (for JS)
JavaScriptCore.dll (for JS)
libpng13.dll (for PNG)
pthreadVC2.dll (for JS)
SDL.dll (for SDL)
zlib1.dll (for ZLib)
